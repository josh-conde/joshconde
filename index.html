            <p>When I’m not deep into coding or exploring new tech, I’m all about getting outdoors and exploring. I love hiking, especially on scenic trails that take me away from screens and into nature. There’s something about reaching a summit or finding a hidden trail that’s incredibly satisfying. I'm also a huge fan of travel, and Japan is at the top of my list, especially for its unique blend of tradition and modernity.<br>At home, I'm often trying out new recipes, and I enjoy mixing up different cooking styles. I'm a big believer in experimenting with new flavors, which sometimes leads to surprising results. Outside of tech, I’m a bit of a DIY enthusiast—I love taking on projects around the house and tackling whatever creative challenge comes my way.</p>
